package Arrays.Playlist;
/*
Create a program that implements a playlist of songs.
        To start you off, implement the following classes:

1.  Album
-  It has three fields, two Strings called name and artist, and an ArrayList that holds objects of type Song called songs.
-  A constructor that accepts two Strings (name of the album and artist). It initialises the fields and instantiates songs.
-  And three methods, they are:
    -  addSong(), has two parameters of type String (title of song), double (duration of song) and returns a boolean. Returns true if the song was added successfully or false otherwise.
    -  findSong(), has one parameter of type String (title of song) and returns a Song. Returns the Song if it exists, null if it doesn't exists.
    -  addToPlayList(), has two parameters of type int (track number of song in album) and LinkedList (the playlist) that holds objects of type Song, and returns a boolean. Returns true if it exists and it was added successfully using the track number, or false otherwise.
    -  addToPlayList(), has two parameters of type String (title of song) and LinkedList (the playlist) that holds objects of type Song, and returns a boolean. Returns true if it exists and it was added successfully using the name of the song, or false otherwise.

2.  Song
-  It has two fields, a String called title and a double called duration.
-  A constructor that accepts a String (title of the song) and a double (duration of the song). It initialises title and duration.
-  And two methods, they are:
     -  getTitle(), getter for title.
     -  toString(), Songs overriding toString method. Returns a String in the following format: "title: duration"
 */

public class Song {

    // member vars
    private String title;
    private double duration;

    // constructors
    public Song(String title, double duration) {
        this.title = title;
        this.duration = duration;
    }

    // getters

    public String getTitle() {
        return title;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return this.title + ": " + this.duration;
    }
}
